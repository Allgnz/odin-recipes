    <p>Shredded mandrake and marinated bat breast are coated in batter and deep fried in olive oil, tempura-style.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>serves 4</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Mandrake (3 med. size)</li>
        <li>Big Bat breast meat (400 grams)</li>
        <li>Basilisk egg (1)</li>
        <li>Weak flour (150 grams)</li>
        <li>Water (170 cc)</li>
        <li>Soy sauce (1 tbsp)</li>
        <li>Sake (1 tbsp)</li>
        <li>Salt (a pinch)</li>
        <li>Garlic & ginger (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the olive oil to heat while we do the rest of the preparations.</li>
        <li>Remove the skin of the Giant Bat and cut the meat into chunks and lightly score it.</li>
        <li>Rub in the seasonings in the meat and let it marinate a bit.</li>
        <li>Skin the Madrake, cut the arms and legs first. If you unravel the tangled up limbs you can tear them off by
            hand.
            <br>
            Then you peel and chop up the Mandrake body (pare away the discolored part where the limbs are).
        </li>
        <li>Beat a Basilisk egg with some water, and sift in some flower.</li>
        <li>Stir it lightly so it doesn't clump and add the mandrake to the batter.</li>
        <li>Scoop the mandrake into the oil and fry it just enough so it doesn't fall apart.</li>
        <li>Finished!</li>
    </ol>
